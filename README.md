## README file
A README file is an essential part of any software project on GitHub. It serves as a documentation and a guide to help other developers understand your project and how to use it. Here are some reasons why a README file is important:

### 1. Introduction
The README file provides an introduction to your project, including what it does, what problem it solves, and what technologies it uses. This is important for other developers who are interested in your project to quickly understand what it's all about and decide if it's relevant to their work.

### 2. Installation
The README file should provide clear and concise instructions on how to install and set up your project. This helps other developers get started quickly and easily, without wasting time figuring out how to install and configure your project.

### 3. Usage
The README file should also explain how to use your project. This includes any commands, parameters, or options that are available, as well as any examples or use cases. This helps other developers get the most out of your project and avoid common mistakes.

### 4. Contribution guidelines
The README file can also provide information on how to contribute to your project. This includes guidelines on how to submit bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. This helps other developers understand how they can contribute to your project and what the expectations are.

### 5. License
Finally, the README file should include information on the license that your project is released under. This is important for other developers to understand what they can and cannot do with your code, and to ensure that your project is used and distributed in accordance with your wishes. For example this project is uder the MIT license

In conclusion, a README file is an important part of any software project on GitHub. It helps other developers understand your project, how to use it, and how to contribute to it. Without a README file, your project may be difficult to understand and use, which can discourage others from getting involved.
